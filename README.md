[Google Apps (G Suite)](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect), [Microsoft Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code), and [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorization-options-for-oauth-apps/) authentication for [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) using [Lambda@Edge](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html). The primary use case for `cloudfront-auth` is to serve private S3 content over HTTPS without running a proxy server to authenticate requests.

## Description
Upon successful authentication, a cookie ( named `TOKEN`) with the value of a newly created and signed JWT is set and the user redirected back to the originally requested path. This JWT cookie is checked for validity (signature, expiration date, audience and matching hosted domain) upon each request and `cloudfront-auth` will redirect the user to configured provider's login when necessary.

## Usage
If your CloudFront distribution is pointed at an S3 bucket, [configure origin access identity](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#private-content-creating-oai-console) so S3 objects can be stored with private permissions.

Enable SSL/HTTPS on your CloudFront distribution; AWS Certificate Manager can be used to provision a certificate.

Lambda@Edge does not support environment variables set in the Lambda console, so a config file is necessary to be included in the upload ZIP file. RSA public/private keys are used to sign a JWT cookie after authorization. If the files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, used to signed the JWT, do not exist they will be automatically generated by the build.

Session duration is the time in seconds that JWT token is valid for. After session expiration, cloudfront-auth will redirect the user to configured provider to re-authenticate. Entering 86400 seconds will set the JWT be valid for 24 hours.

#### Use Github

1. Clone or download this repo
1. On Github [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile) navigate to your organization under "Organization settings", then OAuth Apps under Developer settings.
  1. Select `New OAuth App`
  1. For __Authorization callback URL__ enter your Cloudfront hostname with your preferred path value for the authorization callback. Example: `https://my-cloudfront-site.example.com/_callback`
1. Execute `make` in the downloaded directory. NPM will run to download dependencies and a RSA key will be generated.
  1. Choose `Github` as the authorization method and enter the values for Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI, Session Duration and Organization
      -  cloudfront-auth will check that users are a member of the entered Organization.
1. Upload the resulting `cloudfront-auth.zip` file using the AWS Lambda console and jump to [#configure](configure CloudFront)

#### Use Google

#### Use Microsoft

#### Old
1. Clone or download this repo
1. Create an OAuth 2.0 client with your provider.

   1. Google: Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI, Hosted Domain, Token Age (seconds)
   1. Microsoft: Tenant, Client ID (App ID), Client Secret, Redirect URI, Token Age (seconds)
   1. GitHub: Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI, Token Age (seconds), Organization
1. Following the initial credentials, you may be asked about AuthZ options.
   1. Hosted Domain (*Google*)
      1. Only check that verified email ends with hosted domain. Leave 'Enter email lookup URL' blank.
   1. HTTP Email Lookup (*Google*)
      1. Check that verified email exists in JSON array from given site. Enter email lookup URL when prompted.
   1. Google Groups Lookup (*Google*)
      1. Check that verified email exists in one of given Google Groups.  Download your service account JSON file and rename to 'google-groups-authz.json' (example below).  Place it in the root directory and add the key 'cloudfront_authz_groups' whose value is a JSON array of groups to check.  The Makefile will detect this file exists and will not prompt you to enter an email lookup URL.
   1. Organization Membership Lookup (*GitHub*)
      1. Verify the user that logged in is a member of the given organization.

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome. Please create an issue in order open up communication with the community.

When implementing a new flow or using an already implemented flow, be sure to follow the same style used in `build.js`.  The config.json file should have an object for each request made.  For example, `openid.index.js` converts config.AUTH_REQUEST and config.TOKEN_REQUEST to querystrings for simplified requests (after adding dynamic variables such as state or nonce). For implementations that are not generic (most), endpoints are hardcoded in to the config (or discovery documents).
